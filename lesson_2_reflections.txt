How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is different from the working directory because the files added to the staging area would of already been worked on and waiting to be committed. It is also different from the repository because the repo would contain files that have been changed and committed with the neccesary files altered as intended. The changes that need to made to one file may affect others and therefore these multiple files will need to be committed at the same time. If you change a CSS file, then it probably changes the HTML file too, so rather than 2 seperate commits - one for the CSS file, and one for the HTML file - you can add all the affected files to the staging area and make a single commit with a message that is related to the overall changes made as a whole.
